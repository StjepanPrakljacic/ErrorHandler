# ErrorHandler Requirements

## 1. General Requirements
- The error handler shall be implemented in standard C++ and support integration into embedded, desktop, or cross-platform projects.
- It shall support building with CMake and be compatible with the MiniGW toolchain.
- The component shall function standalone or as a submodule within a larger project.
- The error handler shall integrate with an external logging module (Logger) to log error events.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Error Reporting
- REQ-01: The error handler shall provide a function `reportError(ErrorType type, const std::string& message)` to report an error with an associated type and message.
- REQ-02: The reported error shall be immediately logged using the integrated Logger at the appropriate log level based on `ErrorType`.

### 2.2 Error State Tracking
- REQ-03: The handler shall track the last reported error type.
- REQ-04: The function `getLastErrorType()` shall return the last recorded `ErrorType`.
- REQ-05: The function `getLastErrorMessage()` shall return the last error message as a string.
- REQ-06: The function `reset()` shall clear the stored error state and message.

### 2.3 Recovery Handling
- REQ-07: The error handler shall allow users to register a recovery function via `setRecoveryHandler(std::function<void()>)`.
- REQ-08: The recovery function, if registered, shall be executed via the `executeRecovery()` function.

### 2.4 Return Code Compatibility (Optional)
- REQ-09: The handler may implement a method `toStdReturnCode(ErrorType)` that maps `ErrorType` to AUTOSAR-style return values (`E_OK`, `E_NOT_OK`).

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
- REQ-10: The handler shall be thread-safe (if used in multi-threaded applications) or explicitly documented as single-threaded.
- REQ-11: The module shall build with zero warnings under `-Wall -Wextra` flags on GCC/Clang (MiniGW).
- REQ-12: The handler shall be testable with [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) and come with unit tests covering at least 80% of its public API.
